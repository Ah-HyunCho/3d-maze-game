# 3d-maze-game
This is a quick little three dimensional maze game that I made a while back while trying to learn OpenGL.

## Controls
Left Arrow key = turn camera left

Right Arrow key = turn camera right

Up Arrow key = move forward

Down Arrow key = move backwards

## How to compile the Code
To compile the source code, simply run the following commands:
```
cmake -S 3d-maze-game -B 3d-maze-game/build
cd 3d-maze-game/build
make
```

To run the program just type `./3d-maze`.

**IMPORTANT: The folder 'shaders' must be in the same directory as the exectutable for the game to work!**

**IMPORTANT 2: Some necessary depedencies: [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and [glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/)**

**NOTE: I wrote this targeted towards Linux so there may be some issues on Windows or MacOS. If you figure out a way to compile the source code on these platforms, please fork the project with the necessary adjustments.**
